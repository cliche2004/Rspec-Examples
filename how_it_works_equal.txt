expectation: result.should equal(5)

            result.should(equal(5))

Evaluation:
  1. equal(5) will return Equal#object initialized with 5 
  2. that instance of Equal (matcher) will be passed to should() like result.should(matcher)
  3. should() calls matcher.matches?(self)
  4. matches?(self) returns true, then the Expectation is considered met, and execution moves on to the next line in the example.
  5. If it returns false, ExpectationNotMetException is raised with a message returned by matcher.failure_message().
